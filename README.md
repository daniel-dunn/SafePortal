<h1> Easy Portal - DOT.NET Core</h1>

This was my first attempt at building the Easy Portal idea by using DOT.NET Core. This attempt has been abandoned due to the challenges posed by user authentication and server integration. I have opted to re-attempt using Django.

This project got as far as being able to render a webpage from user data stored in a JSON file.
